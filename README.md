The YOUR TURN today will have you cloning a repo, of which you will add collaborators.  Information on how to do that is here [LINK]https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository).

## Examples in this repository


### `app.R`
Example shiny app deployment through github.  In order to run this you need:

`shiny::runGitHub(repo = "DST490-day14",username = "AugsburgDST490")`

**NOTE:** When you create your own github shiny server:

- Repository visibility needs to be set as public.
- Main file needs to be named `app.R`.
